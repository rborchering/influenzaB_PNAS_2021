# InfluenzaB-2020 Scripts

This repository contains the code used to analyze the 2019/2020 flu season. 

Note on organization: "00" scripts process raw data, "01" scripts format data for a particular purpose, "02" scripts ... TBD based on need. 

For now "06" scripts analyze data

Please keep in mind that each final figure should have its own file, e.g. "08-Figure1" . Code for related supplemental figures can be contained in these files.
